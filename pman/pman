Personal Manual (for stuff I never want to think about again)

-- Get into shell session in docker container
docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash

-- Delete all merged branches in repo
for mergedBranch in $(git for-each-ref --format '%(refname:short)' --merged HEAD refs/heads/) ;do git branch -d $mergedBranch ;done
